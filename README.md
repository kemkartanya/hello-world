# hello-world
It's my first github repository
I am Tanya Kemkar studying Information Technology at Delhi Technological University. I am passionate about coding, tech and amazing things we can do with tech. I really think Programming is a Superpower:)
Apart from technology and coding I like to read books. My favourite book is Diary of A Young Girl:) Also, I like to draw and do yoga. Thankyou for stopping by.
